# SQL Practice Repository üìä

This repository contains my hands-on SQL practice while learning from the book **"Practical SQL: A Beginner's Guide to Storytelling with Data"** by *Anthony DeBarros*. I followed the chapters in order and wrote SQL scripts to apply what I learned in each topic.

The goal of this practice was to build a strong foundation in real-world SQL, improve my data analysis skills, and apply techniques using PostgreSQL.
